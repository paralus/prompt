Paralus Prompt is built on top of kube-prompt, this is integrated in the dashboard. kube-prompt accepts the same commands as the kubectl, except you don't need to provide the kubectl prefix. So it doesn't require the additional cost to use this cli. And you can integrate other commands via pipe (`|`).
